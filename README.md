# MNIST Prediction using Autoencoders

This repository contains a project focused on predicting digits from the MNIST dataset using autoencoders. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 28x28 grayscale images, each representing a handwritten digit from 0 to 9. The project demonstrates the application of autoencoders for image reconstruction and classification tasks.

## Overview

### Dataset
- **MNIST**: A dataset comprising grayscale images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

### Task
- **Digit Prediction**: Using autoencoders to learn efficient representations of the images and classify the digits.

## Models and Techniques
This project employs various deep learning models and techniques, including:
- **Autoencoders**: Utilizing autoencoders to compress and reconstruct images, capturing essential features for classification.
- **Convolutional Autoencoders (CAE)**: Leveraging the power of convolutional layers to extract spatial features from images.
- **Denoising Autoencoders**: Training autoencoders to remove noise from images, enhancing feature extraction.
- **Regularization Techniques**: Implementing dropout and batch normalization to improve model generalization and prevent overfitting.
